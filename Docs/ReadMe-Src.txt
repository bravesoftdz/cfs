________________________________________________________________________________

Source code for the current version of DelphiDabbler Clipboard Format Spy is
always available from http://www.delphidabbler.com/download?id=cfs&type=src.

Clipboard Format Spy's source code is provided in a zip file, dd-cfs-src.zip.
This file includes all Clipboard Format Spy's original code along with some 3rd
party sources. Files should be extracted from the zip file and the directory
structure should be preserved.

The directory structure is:

  Bin        : Binary resource files (*1)
  Src        : Pascal and other source code + batch file controlling build  (*2)
    3rdParty : Supplied 3rd party source code 
    Help     : Source files for the CFS.chm HTML Help file (*3)
      CSS    : Cascading style sheet used by HTML Help file
      HTML   : HTML source documents for HTML help topics
      Images : GIF files used by HTML help file
    Res      : Contains assets that are compiled into resources

  Notes:
    (*1) - See below for details of how to recompile these files
    (*2) - Build batch file described below
    (*3) - Files generated by Microsoft HTML Help Workshop

In order to compile the program you also need to create a "Exe" directory at the
same level as the "Bin" and "Src" directories.

Additional libraries / components are required to compile Clipboard Format Spy
successfully. They are:

  From DelphiDabbler.com:
    Version Information Component (v3.1.1 or later)
    Window State Components (v5.3 or later)
    Clipboard Viewer Component (v1.2 or later)
  The Delphi 7 VCL.

All the libraries need to be available on Delphi's library path.

All components must be installed in the Delphi Component Palette if the program
is to be compiled from the IDE.

The program also requires two binary files in order to compile (provided):

  Version.res   - The program's version information.
  Resources.res - All other resources including main program icon, default CSS
                  for HTML viewer and manifest for XP and Vista.
