		This window renders Rich Text Format code that has been copied to the
		clipboard using the &quot;Rich Text Format&quot; and &quot;Rich Text
		Format Without Objects&quot; formats.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Note:</strong> the &quot;RTF As Text&quot; format is displayed
		in the <a href="viewer-text.htm">text viewer</a> since this format
		appears to be designed for viewing the RTF source code rather than
		rendered text.
	</p>
	<p>
		A context menu is provided to enable the content of the view to be
		selected and copied to the clipboard.
