	<h1>
		Binary Viewer
	</h1>
	<p>
		This window displays binary information about any clipboard format that
		is represented in global memory. Supported formats will have a size
		entry in the main window. This binary viewer is always a secondary
		viewer.
	</p>
	<p>
		The viewer shows 16 bytes of data per line, with each line divided into
		three sections:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Offset &ndash; this is the offset of the start of the
			&quot;line&quot; of 16 bytes from the start of the data. The offset
			is expressed in hex digits and appears on the left of the display.
		</li>
		<li>
			The value of each of the 16 bytes is displayed in the centre of the
			display in hex.
		</li>
		<li>
			The right hand side of the display shows the printable bytes of data
			as text. Unprintable characters are represented as dots.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The display can be scrolled up and down and left to right using the
		scroll bars or by using the following keys:
	</p>
