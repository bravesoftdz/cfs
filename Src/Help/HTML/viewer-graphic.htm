	<p>
		This window displays bitmap and metafile clipboard formats such as
		CF_BITMAP, CF_DIB, CF_ENHMETAFILE and CF_METAFILEPICT.
	</p>
	<p>
		The graphic is displayed in its default size.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a context menu that appears when the graphic is right clicked
		that enables the graphic to be copied back to the clipboard. Metafiles
		are copied as CF_ENHMETAFILE and CF_METAFILEPICT while bitmaps are
		copied as CF_BITMAP, CF_DIB and CF_DIBV5. If the image has an associated
		palette then the palette is also placed on the clipboard in CF_PALETTE
		format.
