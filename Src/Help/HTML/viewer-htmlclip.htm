		This window displays information about the &quot;HTML Format&quot;
		clipboard format.
	</p>
	<p>
		The &quot;HTML Format&quot; format is often used when content is copied
		from a web browser to the clipboard. The format is text based and
		not only supplies the copied HTML but also provides some data about the
		copied HTML. The information provided includes the context of the copied
		HTML containing all required surrounding tags, the fragment actually
		copied, information about the selection (optional) and the source URL.
		The version of the clip format is also displayed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Details of the various pieces of provided information are displayed at
		the top of the window and the HTML is rendered in the lower half of the
		window.
	</p>
	<p>
		To view the underlying data right click &quot;HTML Format&quot; in the
		main display and select <em>View As Text</em> from the popup menu.
	</p>
	<p>
		A context menu is provided to enable the content of the view to be
		selected and copied to the clipboard.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Note:</strong>
		Raw HTML, with no additional clip data, is not displayed in this viewer
		&ndash; see the related <a href="viewer-html.htm">HTML Viewer</a>.
