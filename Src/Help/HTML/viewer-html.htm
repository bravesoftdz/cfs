  <h1>
    HTML Viewer
  </h1>
  <p>
    This window renders HTML that has been copied to the clipboard using
    the &quot;text/html&quot; format used by Firefox and the &quot;HTML
    (HyperText Markup Language)&quot; format used by OpenOffice.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Clipboard Format Spy</em> provides its own default cascading style
    sheet to style the HTML, so the rendered HTML may have a different
    appearance to the original.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    this is not the viewer used for the &quot;HTML Format&quot;
    clipboard format &ndash; this specialised format provides further
    information alongside the HTML. This format is displayed in the
    <a href="viewer-htmlclip.htm">HTML Clip Viewer</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A context menu is provided to enable the content of the view to be
    selected and copied to the clipboard.
