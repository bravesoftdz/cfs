		Overview
	</h1>
	<p>
		This program displays the formats currently recorded on the clipboard.
		It automatically updates the information displayed as the contents of
		the clipboard change. For certain supported formats you can also view
		the clipboard contents. The contents of the clipboard can be deleted.
	</p>
	<p>
		For each format displayed on the clipboard, the following information is
		displayed in the main window:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Code &ndash; this is the identifier used to represent the clipboard
			format. It is displayed in hexadecimal.
		</li>
		<li>
			Description &ndash; this is the description of the clipboard format.
			Symbolic constants are displayed for the Windows standard clipboard
			formats.
		</li>
		<li>
			Size &ndash; this is the size of the data on the clipboard. No value
			is displayed if the clipboard contents are not stored in global
			memory.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The display can be sorted in ascending or descending order on any
		column. Simply click a column header to sort by that column. Clicking
		twice reverses the sort order. The display columns can be resized by
		dragging the edge of the column headers.
	</p>
	<p>
		To view a clipboard format select it in the display and right-click to
		display a pop-up menu. Select the required viewer from the menu. If the
		format can't be viewed &quot;no viewer&quot; will be displayed in the
		menu. <a href="viewers.htm">More info</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The file name of the process that owns the clipboard is displayed in the
		status bar. This is the process that last copied data to, or cleared,
		the clipboard.
	</p>
	<p>
		The window can be resized and the program remembers the size and
		position information between executions.
	</p>
	<p>
