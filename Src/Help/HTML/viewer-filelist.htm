	<h1>
		File List Viewer
	</h1>
	<p>
		This window displays lists of files that have been provided via the
		CF_HDROP and &quot;Shell IDList Array&quot; clipboard formats.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the case of CF_HDROP the display lists files that have been copied
		to the clipboard whilst for &quot;Shell IDList Array&quot; the display
		shows both a root folder and a list of contained files. The display
		distinguishes between files and folders &ndash; different icons are
		used.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Right clicking in the main window displays a popup menu. The items on
		the menu depend on the context.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			A <em>Copy File List</em> menu item is always available. This causes
			a list of files to be copied to the clipboard as text, with each
			file or folder name separated by CRLF.
		</li>
		<li>
			If a folder is right clicked then an <em>Explore</em> default menu
			item is also provided. Clicking this item causes Explorer to be
			opened with the folder selected.
		</li>
		<li>
			When a file entry is right clicked the default option changes to
			<em>Open</em> and selecting the option causes the program to attempt
			to open the file in any associated application. If there is no such
			application an error message is displayed.
		</li>
	</ul>
